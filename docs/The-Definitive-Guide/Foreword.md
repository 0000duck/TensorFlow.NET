# Foreword 前言

One of the most nerve-wracking periods when releasing the first version of an open source project occurs when the gitter community is created. You are all alone, eagerly hoping and wishing for the first user to come along. I still vividly remember those days. 



当我开始写这个项目的时候，我同时也在整理编码过程时候的想法，Tensorflow是个巨大最复杂的工程，很容易超出个人能力范围，所以想尽可能地把当时的思路记录下来，也想趁着记录整理的过程把思路理清。

When I started writing this project, I was also sorting out the idea of the coding process. Tensorflow is a huge and complicated project, and it is easy to go beyond the scope of personal ability. Therefore, I want to record the thoughts at the time as much as possible. The process of recording and sorting clears the way of thinking.
