# Get started with TensorFlow.NET

让我们先运行一个经典的HelloWorld程序，看看TensorFlow是在.NET上面运行的效果，我想不出有比做个HelloWorld再简单的方式了。

Let's run a classic HelloWorld program first and see if TensorFlow is running on .NET. I can't think of a simpler way to be a HelloWorld.

### Install the TensorFlow.NET SDK

To start building TensorFlow program you just need to download and install the .NET SDK (Software Development Kit).

```cmd
PM> Install-Package TensorFlow.NET
```
